# dead_d0g's AC04 Cheat Engine repository

Welcome! In this repository I'll be uploading the tables I've created with Cheat Engine (CE) for Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies.

These tables contains scripts and a compilation of relevant memory addresses that are product of my own research and have helped me to understand how the game works by finding information as well giving the opportunity to modify it and find new things.

While these scripts are primarily used for research they can also be used for cheating. Stuff like giving the player infinite ammo, health, time, etc. can be also achieved with said scripts.

#### Required files and tools:

- Cheat Engine 7.0 or latest installed in your computer. You can download the program from its [official website](https://www.cheatengine.org/).

- PCSX2 emulator, the last **_stable_** release (version 1.6.0) which you can download from PCSX2's [official website](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/). **[See NOTES]**

- An ISO file of Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies **[See NOTES]**.

  At the moment the current supported versions are:
  - **[SLPM_60149]: Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies -TRIAL VERSION-**

#### Notes:

- At the time of setting up this repository **these tables will not work with the newest releases of PCSX2.** This is due to me still being on Windows 7 and being unable to migrate to Windows 10 due to lack of time. The PCSX2 dev team has also dropped support for W7 so I can't test these table on the latest releases of the emulator. So this is why I'm ask you to download and use the last stable release.
  - To check if you are using a compatible version of PCSX2 when you attach this table to the emulator the entries in it will change to numeric values from"??????????". If this is not the case then the table is not compatible with the version  of PCSX2 you are using.
 
 - At the moment these tables will only support the trial/demo version of AC04, but support for the vanilla version of the game will be added in the future.
